# Polling System Smart Contract

## Description:
This project is a smart contract for a polling system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The system allows users to create polls with multiple choices, vote within a specified time period, and determine the winner automatically. The contract uses advanced data structures such as mappings and arrays to store poll data and votes.

## Features:
- **Create Polls**: Users can create polls with multiple choices.
- **Vote**: Users can vote on polls within a specific time period.
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Polls can have a set duration, after which voting is closed.
- **Winner Determination**: The contract calculates and determines the winner automatically.
- **Smart Contract**: Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE.
